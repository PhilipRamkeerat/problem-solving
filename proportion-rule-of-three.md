# 📘 Proportion and Rule of Three – Complete Guide

## 📌 1. What Is Proportion?

A **proportion** is an equality between two ratios.

### 🔹 Example of a Ratio:
If there are 10 girls and 5 boys in a class:
```
10 / 5 = 2 → "There are 2 girls for every 1 boy"
```

## 📐 2. What Is the Rule of Three?

The **Rule of Three** helps you solve proportion problems involving **three known values** and **one unknown (x)**.

## ✏️ 3. How to Solve Rule of Three

### ✅ Step-by-step:
1. Identify if it’s **direct** or **inverse** proportion.
2. Create a table with 3 known values and 1 unknown.
3. Use **cross multiplication** to solve for x.

## ➕ 4. Example 1 – Direct Proportion

> If 2 people make 10 boxes per day, how many boxes will 4 people make?

| People | Boxes |
|--------|-------|
|   2    |  10   |
|   4    |   x   |

Cross multiplication:
```
2 × x = 4 × 10 → 2x = 40 → x = 20
```

✅ **Answer: 20 boxes**

## ➖ 5. Example 2 – Inverse Proportion

> If 3 people complete a task in 6 days, how many people are needed to do it in 2 days?

| People | Days |
|--------|------|
|   3    |  6   |
|   x    |  2   |

This is **inverse proportion**: more people → less time

Cross multiplication:
```
3 × 6 = x × 2 → 18 = 2x → x = 9
```

✅ **Answer: 9 people**

## 🧪 6. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1:
If 5 people paint 10 walls in 2 days, how many walls can 10 people paint in 2 days?

### Exercise 2:
If 4 machines produce 80 parts in 1 hour, how many parts will 6 machines produce in 2 hours?

## 💡 Tips
- Direct proportion: increase → increase
- Inverse proportion: increase → decrease
- Always align your table and multiply across
